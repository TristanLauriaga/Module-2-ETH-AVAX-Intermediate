# ETH + AVAX Intermediate Module 2

This is my take on our Assessment on Module 2. We are tasked to make a smart contract and has a frontend communicating with it

## Description

This program is written in solidity and javascript, programming languages used in web3 blockchain. And I used VSCODE for my IDE compiler. A brief description on the purpose and use of my assessment. This is a Rune dispenser for elden ring you can "STORE" runes and "CONSUME" them.

You can gey the code in the website https://github.com/TristanLauriaga/Module-2-ETH-AVAX-Intermediate. When you get there just add the file and then there you go you can run my code and test it out for yourself.

========================================

## Changed functions and UI

I have changed quite a number of functions to make the code as different as Mr.Chris is. As you run my code you will see the difference in of course the front end and my code will let you input your desired ammount to be put into. Also you can see the Transaction history with every transaction made. Then the last addition to my code is the confirmation window when you want to store and consume runes.

## Setting up and running the code

Before you can run the system there are steps on doing this:

* 1st Step is to clone the github of Mr.Chris here is the link https://github.com/MetacrafterChris/SCM-Starter
* 2nd is to run 3 terminals, the first terminal is to download the node.js addon by typing the command npm i in your first terminal you can download here node.js here https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager
* 3rd step in the 2nd terminal run the command npx hardhat node
* 4th step is to go the the 3rd terminal and run the command npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
* 5th step is to go to the 1st terminal and again run the code npm run dev to fire up the UI. it will typically throw the link of the frontend UI http://localhost:3000/
* 6th step is to download the metamask wallet extention and connect it to the UI 

after this just play around with it and make sure that it is running properly.
